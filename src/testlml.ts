export default `(Let $x$ be an arbitrary element of $X$),[To prove $f$ is continous by we need to ,*show*,[$f(x)^{x^{2^x}}$], that for all elements $x$ of $X$ and neighborhooods $V$ of $f(x)$,[which can be seen by using your brain]],. One can see it suffices to prove that for
 all closed neighborhoods $V'$ of $f(x)$ there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $f(U) \\subseteq V'$. We see the following argument,[Let $V'$ be a neighborhood of $f(x)$.]`
